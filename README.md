# WeatherData
The program was built specifically considering data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration North American Mesoscale Forecast System. It can be ran feeding file names to the command line. The expected format of the lines in these files is a state abbreviation, timestamp, geolocation, humidity, indicator of snow, cloud cover, indicator of lightning, pressure, and temperature in Kelvin. They should appear in this order, separated by tabs. Examples are provided with the .tdv files. climate.c will output findings/calculations from the data, organized by state, such as average temperature and number of records found with snow cover.
